Modelling Pollutant Transport in a River

## Overview
This repository contains coursework for the Computational Numerical Methods (CNM) module.
The aim of the project is to model the one-dimensional transport of a pollutant in a river
using the advection equation. A finite difference numerical method is used to simulate how
pollutant concentration evolves in space and time.

The project was developed collaboratively using GitHub, with branches, commits and pull
requests used to manage contributions from all group members.

## Governing Equation
The pollutant transport is modelled using the 1D advection equation:

∂θ/∂t = −U ∂θ/∂x

where:
- θ is the pollutant concentration (μg/m³)
- t is time (s)
- x is distance along the river (m)
- U is the river velocity (m/s)
